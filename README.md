# Sergio Rhettwind

Senior Go Engineer with strong commercial background in high-load backend systems  
and hands-on experience as a full stack developer.

## About
I work primarily on **production systems in private commercial repositories**.
My daily work involves designing, implementing, and maintaining Go-based microservices
with a strong focus on reliability, performance, and concurrency.

In addition to backend work, I regularly build and maintain **web interfaces and tools**
as a full stack developer (JavaScript, React, Node.js).

Over the last years, I average **800–1000+ pull requests per year** across multiple
closed-source projects.

Public GitHub represents **side projects, demos, and experiments only**.

## What I work on
- Go microservices (market data, trading, execution, analytics)
- Exchange integrations (REST / WebSocket)
- Concurrency, synchronization, data consistency
- High-throughput and fault-tolerant systems
- Event-driven architectures
- Web dashboards and internal tools

## Tech stack
- **Backend:** Go
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, React
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Redis
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ, gPRC
- **Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **APIs:** REST, WebSocket
- **Other:** Linux, Git, CI/CD

## Open source & code samples
Due to NDA restrictions, I cannot publish production code.
This profile may include:
- architecture demos
- isolated technical examples
- tooling and experiments

I’m happy to discuss real production decisions, trade-offs,
and system design during interviews.
